#### Executive summary
In the world of growing needs and the panedmeic adding a new dimension to online shoping , its both interesting and rewarding to look into the market data 
not just to predict the upcoming demands which is obviously the primary purpose of this predictive algorithm / model research . However its alos interesting that in future this data can be used for pattern detection , lifestyle analysis or even for health related analysis / predictions .
Thus is an effort to work on a large dataset to work out the most effective predicitve algorithm possible .

#### Rationale
Why should anyone care about this question?

There are several reasons why someone might care about predicting the products that are likely to be reordered in the next order for the Instacart dataset:

Improved Inventory Management: Knowing which products are likely to be reordered can help retailers and e-commerce platforms like Instacart to better manage their inventory. This can lead to better availability of products, fewer out-of-stock situations, and improved customer satisfaction.

Better Marketing Strategies: Understanding which products are likely to be reordered can help companies to create targeted marketing campaigns for those products. This can improve the efficiency of marketing efforts and help to increase sales.

Enhanced Customer Experience: Predicting the products that are likely to be reordered can help retailers to personalize the shopping experience for their customers. By offering recommendations based on past orders, retailers can make it easier for customers to find the products they need and encourage them to return for future purchases.

Increased Revenue: By predicting the products that are likely to be reordered, companies can potentially increase their revenue by ensuring that popular products are always in stock and available for customers to purchase.

Overall, predicting the products that are likely to be reordered in the next order for the Instacart dataset can help companies to optimize their operations, improve their customer experience, and increase their revenue.

#### Research Question
What are you trying to answer?

As the person who conducted the analysis on the Instacart dataset, I was trying to answer the question of which products are likely to be reordered in the next order. This is a binary classification problem, where the task is to predict whether a product will be reordered or not.

By analyzing historical order data and using machine learning algorithms like xgboost, I was able to identify the products that are most likely to be reordered in the next order, and also identify the factors that influence the likelihood of a product being reordered.

Overall, my goal was to provide insights and recommendations to Instacart on how to optimize their inventory management, improve their marketing strategies, enhance their customer experience, and increase their revenue based on predicting the products that are likely to be reordered.

#### Data Sources
What data will you use to answer you question?

The instacart dataset on kaggle.

#### Methodology
What methods are you using to answer the question?

Xgboost classification.

#### Results
What did your research find?

Based on the analysis of the Instacart dataset using xgboost, my research found the following:

Identified the most commonly reordered products: By analyzing the historical order data, I identified the most frequently reordered products. This information can help Instacart to understand the popular items and prioritize their stock accordingly.

Factors that influence the likelihood of a product being reordered: I identified the factors that influence the likelihood of a product being reordered, such as the number of times it has been ordered, the number of times it has been reordered, and the time elapsed since the last order. This information can be used to optimize the ordering and restocking process for Instacart.

Identified the products that are less likely to be reordered: I also identified the products that are less likely to be reordered, which can help Instacart to understand the less popular items and potentially reduce their stock.

Overall, my research found that xgboost can be an effective algorithm to predict which products are likely to be reordered in the next order for the Instacart dataset
